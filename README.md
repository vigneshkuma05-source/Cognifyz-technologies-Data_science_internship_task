## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Vignesh L**, an undergraduate student in **Bachelor of Computer Application** at **Seshadripuram  College**, graduating in **July 2026**.

I have a deep passion for **Data Science**, especially the parallels between **artificial intelligence** and the **human brain**. I enjoy working with data—whether it's cleaning messy datasets, performing statistical modeling, or building ML models that turn raw data into powerful insights.

Currently, I'm developing skills in:
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**
- **Web Development**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – my primary research interest

With a *questionably inclined mind* shaped by poetry and literature, I consider myself a lifelong learner—always exploring the evolving intersection between **humans and machines**.
